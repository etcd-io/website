title: Upgrade etcd from v3.5 to v3.6
weight: 6600
description: Processes, checklists, and notes on upgrading etcd from v3.5 to v3.6
---

In the general case, upgrading from etcd v3.5 to v3.6 can be a zero-downtime, rolling upgrade:

- one by one, stop the etcd v3.5 processes and replace them with etcd v3.6 processes
- after running all v3.6 processes, new features in v3.6 are available to the cluster

Before [starting an upgrade](#upgrade-procedure), read through the rest of this guide to prepare.

### Upgrade checklists

#### Update 3.5

{{% alert title="Important" color="warning" %}}
Before upgrading to 3.6, make sure that [all of your 3.5 members are updated to 3.5.24 or later](https://etcd.io/blog/2025/upgrade_from_3.5_to_3.6_issue/). Updating will prevent the "too many learner member" error which causes upgrade to fail, refer to <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/19557> and <https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/20793>. {{% /alert %}}

#### V2 Store

**NOTE:** If the `--enable-v2` flag is not configured or is set to false, no further action is required.

If `--enable-v2` or the environment variable `ETCD_ENABLE_V2="true"` **is** configured, additional steps are required to handle the v2store data:

1. If there is data in the v2store that needs to be migrated to the v3store, follow the [v2 migration guide](../../../v3.4/op-guide/v2-migration/) to migrate the data.

2. Remove the `--enable-v2` flag and the `ETCD_ENABLE_V2="true"` environment variable.

3. Run the command `etcdutl check v2store` to verify whether the v2store contains any non-membership (custom) data. If no custom data is present, no further action is required.

4. If custom data is detected in the v2store, apply the following workaround to remove the legacy data:

    - Add the flag `--snapshot-count=1` to each etcd instnace that contains custom data in the v2store.
    - Restart the etcd instances.
    - Remove the `--snapshot-count=1` flag from (or restore to its original value, if applicable) from all etcd instances.
    - Restart the etcd instances again.

5. Run the `etcdutl check v2store` command once more to verify that the v2store no longer contains any non-membership (custom) data. At this point, there should be no custom data remaining in the v2store.

Once these steps are completed, the v2store is clean, and the upgrade process can proceed.

### Server upgrade checklists

#### Upgrade requirements

To upgrade an existing etcd deployment to v3.6, the running cluster must be v3.5 or greater. If it's before v3.5, please [upgrade to v3.5](../upgrade_3_4/) before upgrading to v3.6.

Also, to ensure a smooth rolling upgrade, the running cluster must be healthy. Check the health of the cluster by using the `etcdctl endpoint health` command before proceeding.

#### Preparation

Before upgrading etcd, always test the services relying on etcd in a staging environment before deploying the upgrade to the production environment.

Before beginning, [download the snapshot backup](../../op-guide/maintenance/#snapshot-backup). Should something go wrong with the upgrade, it is possible to use this backup to [rollback](#rollback) back to existing etcd version. Please note that the `snapshot` command only backs up the v3 data.

#### Mixed versions

While upgrading, an etcd cluster supports mixed versions of etcd members, and operates with the protocol of the lowest common version. The cluster is only considered upgraded once all of its members are upgraded to version v3.6. Internally, etcd members negotiate with each other to determine the overall cluster version, which controls the reported version and the supported features.

#### Rollback

Before upgrading your etcd cluster, please create and [download a snapshot backup](../../op-guide/maintenance/#snapshot-backup) of your etcd cluster. This snapshot can be used to restore the cluster to its pre-upgrade state if needed. If users encounter issues during the upgrade, they should first identify and resolve the root cause. If the cluster is still in a mixed-version state where at least one member remains on v3.5, they can either replace the binary or image with the old v3.5 version or restore the cluster directly using the snapshot. In this mixed state, the cluster continues to operate as a v3.5 cluster, allowing rollback without following a formal downgrade process.

However, once all members have been upgraded to v3.6, the cluster is considered fully upgraded and rollback using binaries is no longer possible. In that case, the only recovery option is to restore from the snapshot taken before the upgrade. If users wish to return to the original version after a full upgrade has completed, they should follow the official downgrade guide to ensure consistency and avoid data corruption.

### Upgrade procedure

This example shows how to upgrade a 3-member v3.5 etcd cluster running on a local machine.

#### Step 1: check upgrade requirements

Is the cluster healthy and running v3.5.x?

```bash
etcdctl --endpoints=localhost:2379,localhost:22379,localhost:32379 endpoint health
<<COMMENT
localhost:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 2.555774ms
localhost:32379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 2.631133ms
localhost:22379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 3.020958ms
COMMENT

curl http://localhost:2379/version
<<COMMENT
{"etcdserver":"3.5.18","etcdcluster":"3.5.0"}
COMMENT

curl http://localhost:22379/version
<<COMMENT
{"etcdserver":"3.5.18","etcdcluster":"3.5.0"}
COMMENT

curl http://localhost:32379/version
<<COMMENT
{"etcdserver":"3.5.18","etcdcluster":"3.5.0"}
COMMENT
```

#### Step 2: download snapshot backup from leader

[Download the snapshot backup](../../op-guide/maintenance/#snapshot-backup) to provide a downgrade path should any problems occur.

etcd leader is guaranteed to have the latest application data, thus fetch snapshot from leader:

```bash
curl -sL http://localhost:2379/metrics | grep etcd_server_is_leader
<<COMMENT
# HELP etcd_server_is_leader Whether or not this member is a leader. 1 if is, 0 otherwise.
# TYPE etcd_server_is_leader gauge
etcd_server_is_leader 1
COMMENT

curl -sL http://localhost:22379/metrics | grep etcd_server_is_leader
<<COMMENT
etcd_server_is_leader 0
COMMENT

curl -sL http://localhost:32379/metrics | grep etcd_server_is_leader
<<COMMENT
etcd_server_is_leader 0
COMMENT

etcdctl --endpoints=localhost:2379 snapshot save backup.db

#### Step 3: stop one existing etcd server

When each etcd process is stopped, expected errors will be logged by other cluster members. This is normal since a cluster member connection has been (temporarily) broken:

```

#### Step 4: restart the etcd server with same configuration

Restart the etcd server with same configuration but with the new etcd binary.

```diff
-etcd-old --name ${name} \
+etcd-new --name ${name} \
  --data-dir /path/to/${name}.etcd \
  --listen-client-urls http://localhost:2379 \
  --advertise-client-urls http://localhost:2379 \
  --listen-peer-urls http://localhost:2380 \
  --initial-advertise-peer-urls http://localhost:2380 \
  --initial-cluster s1=http://localhost:2380,s2=http://localhost:22380,s3=http://localhost:32380 \
  --initial-cluster-token tkn \
  --initial-cluster-state new
```

The new v3.6 etcd will publish its information to the cluster. At this point, cluster still operates as v3.5 protocol, which is the lowest common version.

Verify that each member, and then the entire cluster, becomes healthy with the new v3.6 etcd binary:

```bash
etcdctl endpoint health --endpoints=localhost:2379,localhost:22379,localhost:32379
<<COMMENT
localhost:2379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 1.704998ms
localhost:22379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 2.331754ms
localhost:32379 is healthy: successfully committed proposal: took = 2.490705ms
COMMENT
```

Un-upgraded members will log warnings like the following until the entire cluster is upgraded.

This is expected and will cease after all etcd cluster members are upgraded to v3.6:

```bash
{"level":"warn","ts":"2025-03-01T04:40:37.545960+0530","caller":"etcdserver/cluster_util.go:189","msg":"leader found higher-versioned member","local-member-version":"3.5.18","remote-member-id":"bf9071f4639c75cc","remote-member-version":"3.6.0-alpha.0"}
```

#### Step 5: repeat *step 3* and *step 4* for rest of the members

When all members are upgraded, the cluster will report upgrading to v3.6 successfully:
