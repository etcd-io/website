When we [launched etcd 3.4 back in August 2019][3.4-blog], our focus was on
storage backend improvements, non-voting member and pre-vote features. Since then,
etcd has become more widely used for various mission critical clustering and database
applications and as a result, its feature set has grown more broad and complex. Thus,
improving its stability and reliability has been top priority in recent
development.

Today, we are releasing [etcd 3.5][]. The past two years
allowed for extensive iterations in fixing numerous bugs, identifying
optimization opportunities at scale, and evolving its surrounding ecosystem.
The etcd project also became a
[CNCF graduated project](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2020/11/24/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-etcd-graduation/)
during this time frame. This release is the result of continuous evolution and
grungy, thankless tasks done by the etcd community.

In this blog post, we review the most notable changes to etcd 3.5, and present a
project road map for future releases. For a complete list of changes, see
[CHANGELOG 3.5][]. For more updates, follow us on Twitter [@etcdio][]. To get
etcd, see [Install][].

## Security

Given that etcd often handles sensitive data, improving and maintaining security
posture is our highest priority. In order to have a comprehensive understanding
of etcd security landscape, we completed third-party security audits: The first
report was published in February 2020, where we identified (and fixed) various
edge cases and high severity issues. For more information, see [security audit
report](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/SECURITY_AUDIT.pdf).

To adhere to the highest levels of security best practices, etcd now has a
[security release
process](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/security/security-release-process.md),
and runs automated tests with static analysis tools, such as `errcheck`,
`ineffassign`, and others.

## Features

The **migration to structured logging is complete**. etcd now defaults to
[zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) logger that has a reflection-free,
zero-allocation JSON encoder. We have deprecated
[capnslog](https://github.com/coreos/pkg/issues/57) that logged with
reflection-based serialization.

**etcd now supports built-in log rotation** that configures rotate thresholds,
compression algorithms, etc. For more information, see [hexfusion@ of Red Hat's code change](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12774).

**etcd now emits more detailed tracing information for expensive requests**, such as:

```
{
"caller":"traceutil/trace.go:116",
"msg":"trace[123] range",
"detail":"{
    range_begin:foo;
    range_end:fooo; response_count:100000; response_revision:191496;}",
"duration":"132.449773ms",
"start":"...:32.611-0700",
"end":"...:32.744-0700",
"steps":[
    "trace[123] step 'range keys from bolt db' (duration: 92.521911ms)",
    "trace[123] step 'filter and sort the key-value pairs' (duration: 22.789099ms)"]}
```

This provides a very useful signal for understanding the lifetime of a request
spanning multiple etcd server components. See [YoyinZyc@'s code change (from
Google)](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/11179).

Each etcd cluster maintains its own cluster version, a value agreed on by the
quorum of the cluster. Previously, downgrading such cluster versions (e.g., etcd
minor version from 3.5 to 3.4) was not supported in order to protect against
incompatible changes.

Let's say we allow 3.3 node to join 3.4 cluster and send a
lease checkpoint request to the leader, which was introduced only in etcd 3.4.
When 3.3 node receives the lease checkpoint request, it fails to
handle the unknown apply request (see [etcd server apply
code](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/v3.3.25/etcdserver/apply.go#L119-L170)).
However, one might not use such a lease checkpointer feature and be **willing to
risk incompatible changes in order to perform emergency rollbacks** (e.g., major
defect in new etcd versions). To ensure such rollbacks are easy and reliable,
we've added a **downgrade API that validates, enables, and cancels etcd version
downgrades**. For more information, see [YoyinZyc@ of
Google's code change ](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/11715).

By requiring quorum agreement, etcd cluster membership applies with the same level of consistency as writes.
Previously however, the member list call was directly
served from the server's local data, which could be stale. Now, **etcd serves the
member list with a linearizable guarantee &mdash; if the server is disconnected from the
quorum, the member list call will fail**. See [jingyih@ of
Google's code change](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/11639).

**gRPC gateway endpoint is now stable under `/v3/*`**. gRPC gateway generates an
HTTP API to make etcd gRPC-based HTTP/2 protocol accessible via HTTP/1, such as:

```
curl -X POST -L http://localhost:2379/v3/kv/put -d '{"key": "Zm9v", "value": "YmFy"}'
```

**etcd client now uses the latest gRPC, v1.32.0, requires a new
import path `"go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3"`**, and migrates balancer
implementation upstream. For more information, see [ptabor@ of
Google's code change](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12671).

## Bug fixes

etcd reliability and correctness are of utmost importance. That is why we
backport all critical bug fixes to previous etcd releases. The following are
the notable bugs we identified and fixed during etcd 3.5 development:

1. Lease objects piling up caused memory leaks, and the solution was to clear the expired
lease queue in the old leader. For details, see [tangcong@ of Tencent's fix](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/11731).
1. Ongoing compact operation caused deadlock in mvcc storage layer. For details, see [tangcong@ of Tencent's fix](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/11817).
1. etcd server restart had redundant backend database open operations and as a result, reloading
40-million keys took over 5-minutes, and the solution reduced the restart time by half.
For details, see [tangcong@ of Tencent's fix](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/11779).
1. If etcd crashed before completing defragmentation, the next defragment operation
might have read the corrupted file. The solution was to ignore and overwrite the
existing file. See [jpbetz@ of Google's fix](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/11613).
1. Client cancelling watch did not signal the server to create leaky watchers. The solution was to
explicitly send a cancel request to the server. See [jackkleeman@ of Apple's fix](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/11850).

## Performance

Kubernetes, the most prominent user of etcd, queries the entire keyspace to list
and watch its cluster resources. This range query happens whenever the resource
is not found in the `kube-apiserver` reflector cache (e.g., requested etcd revision
has been compacted, see [kube-apiserver v1.21
code](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.21.0/staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/tools/cache/reflector.go#L302-L312)),
often causing slowness in reads from overloaded etcd servers (see [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12678)). In such cases,
`kube-apiserver` tracing warns as below:

```
"List" url:/api/v1/pods,user-agent... (started: ...) (total time: 1.208s): Trace[...]: [1.208s] [1.204s] Writing http response done count:4346
```

And etcd warns as follows:

```
etcdserver: read-only range request key:"/registry/pods/" range_end:"/registry/pods0" revision:... range_response_count:500 size:291984 took too long (723.099118ms) to execute
```

Our deep-dive into etcd heap profile uncovered major inefficiency in the server
warning logger that had a redundant encoding operation only to compute the size
of range responses with
[`proto.Size`](https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/blob/v1.3.2/proto/table_marshal.go#L2913-L2931)
call. As a result, **a large range query had up to 60% heap allocation overhead,
thus causing out-of-memory crashes, or OOM, in overloaded etcd servers** (see
*Figure 1*). We **optimized the protocol buffer message size operation**
and as a result, **reduced etcd memory consumption up to 50% during peak usage** (see
*Figure 2*). It was a set of small code changes, but for years, such performance
achievements were invisible without extensive testing and workload simulation. See
[chaochn47@ of Amazon Web
Services's investigation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12835) and [patch to replace
`proto.Size` calls](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12871).

_**Figure 1:** etcd heap usage during a slow request warn logging for computing response size of a protocol buffer message. 61% of the heap was allocated in the `proto.Size` call path that encodes all key-value pairs in the message to compute the size._

![figure-2](../announcing-etcd-3.5/figure-2.png "Diagram of etcd heap usage during range query before and after replacing the proto.Size call.")

_**Figure 2:** etcd heap usage during range query before and after replacing the `proto.Size` call. Optimizing the `proto.Size` call in the etcd server reduced memory usage up to 50%._

The etcd 3.4 release made backend read transactions fully concurrent by copying
transaction buffers rather than sharing between writes and concurrent reads (see
[code change from 3.4 release](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/10523)).
However, such a buffering mechanism comes with unavoidable copy overhead and
negatively impacted write-heavy transaction performance, as creating concurrent
read transactions acquires a mutex lock which then blocks incoming write
transactions.

etcd 3.5 improvements further increase transaction concurrency.
1. If a transaction includes a `PUT` (update) operation, the transaction instead shares the transaction buffer between reads and writes (same behavior as 3.3) in order to avoid copying buffers. This transaction mode can be disabled via `etcd --experimental-txn-mode-write-with-shared-buffer=false`.

    The benchmark results show that the **transaction throughput with a high write ratio has increased up to 2.7 times by avoiding copying buffers when creating a write transaction** (see *Figures 3* and *4*).
    This **benefits all kube-apiserver create and update calls that use etcd transactions** (see [etcd3 store v1.21 code](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.21.0/staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/etcd3/store.go#L394-L401)).
    For more information, see [wilsonwang371@ of ByteDance's code change and benchmark results](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12896).

    ![figure-3](../announcing-etcd-3.5/figure-3.png "Diagrams of etcd transaction throughput that shows that with a shared buffer approach for writes, the transaction throughput increases up to 2.7 times.")
    _**Figure 3:** etcd transaction ratio with a high write ratio. The value at the top is the ratio of reads and writes. The first ratio, 0.125, is 1 read per 8 writes. The second ratio, 0.25, is 1 read for 4 writes. The value at the right bar represents the inverse ratio of transaction throughput before and after [etcd/pull/12896](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12896). With the shared buffer approach for writes, the transaction throughput is increased up to 2.7 times._

    ![figure-4](../announcing-etcd-3.5/figure-4.png "Diagrams of etcd transaction throughput that shows that with a shared buffer approach for writes, the transaction throughput increases up to 25%")

    _**Figure 4:** etcd transaction ratio with a high read ratio. The value at the top is the ratio of reads and writes. The first ratio, 4.0, is 4 reads per 1 write. The second ratio, 8.0, is 8 reads per 1 write. The value at the right bar represents the inverse ratio of transaction throughput before and after [etcd/pull/12896](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12896). With the shared buffer approach for writes, the transaction throughput is increased up to 25%._

1. etcd now caches the transaction buffer to avoid the unnecessary copy operations. This speeds up concurrent read transaction creation and as a result, the **transaction with a high read ratio has increased up to 2.4 times** (see *Figures 5* and *6*). See [wilsonwang371@ of ByteDance's code change and benchmark results](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12933).

    ![figure-5](../announcing-etcd-3.5/figure-5.png "Diagrams of etcd transaction throughput that shows with the caching mechanism for read transations, the transaction throughput increases up to 1.4 times.")

    _**Figure 5:** etcd transaction ratio with a high write ratio. The value at the top is the ratio of reads and writes. The first ratio, 0.125, is 1 read per 8 writes. The second ratio, 0.25, is 1 read per 4 writes. The value at the right bar represents the inverse ratio of transaction throughput before and after [etcd/pull/12933](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12933). With the caching mechanism for read transactions, the transaction throughput is increased up to 1.4 times._

    ![figure-6](../announcing-etcd-3.5/figure-6.png "Diagrams of etcd transaction throughput that shows with the caching mechanism for read transations, the transaction throughput increases up to 2.5 times.")

    _**Figure 6:** etcd transaction ratio with a high read ratio. The value at the top is the ratio of reads and writes. The first ratio, 4.0, is 4 reads per 1 write. The second ratio, 8.0, is 8 reads per 1 write. The value at the right bar represents the inverse ratio of transaction throughput before and after [etcd/pull/12933](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12933). With the caching mechanism for read transactions, the transaction throughput is increased up to 2.5 times._

## Monitoring

Long-running load tests revealed that etcd server misrepresented its real memory
usage by masking the impact of Go garbage collection. We discovered that etcd server with Go 1.12 changed the runtime to use `MADV_FREE` in Linux kernel, and as a result, reclaimed memory was not
reflected in the resident set size, or RSS, metric. This had made the etcd memory
usage metric inaccurately static, thus showing no sign of Go garbage collection.
To fix this monitoring problem, we compile etcd 3.5 with Go 1.16 that defaults
to `MADV_DONTNEED` on Linux. For more information, see *Figure 7* and [GitHub Go issue 42330](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42330).

![figure-7](../announcing-etcd-3.5/figure-7.png)

_**Figure 7:** etcd memory usage during range query before and after setting `MADV_DONTNEED` in Go runtime. When run with `GODEBUG=madvdontneed=1"` or Go v1.16 or later, the etcd server accurately reports its memory usage in the CloudWatch `mem_used` metric or other monitoring tools such as `top`._

Monitoring is a fundamental service for reliability and observability. Monitoring
enables individual service owners to understand the current state and identify
possible causes for problem reports. Known as telemetry, the goal is to detect early warning signs and
diagnose potential issues. etcd creates server logs with tracing
information and publishes Prometheus metrics.

This information helps us determine possible
service impacts and causes. However, when a request call chain spans
multiple external components (e.g., from `kube-apiserver` to etcd), it is harder
to identify the issue. In order to efficiently identify the root cause, we
added distributed tracing support using
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io): When the **distributed tracing is
enabled, etcd now uses OpenTelemetry to produce a trace across the RPC call
chain and thus easily integrate with the surrounding ecosystem**. See
*Figure 8*, [lilic@ of Red Hat's proposal](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12919), and [GitHub issue 12460](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12460).

## Testing

Distributed systems are full of subtle edge cases. The fact that a bug may only
emerge under special circumstances warrants exhaustive test coverage beyond
simple unit testing. etcd runs integration, end-to-end, and failure injection
tests, which provide a reliable and faster way to validate each change. However,
as development continued with extended feature sets, flaky tests quickly piled
up draining our productivity. So, we took on the series of arduous tasks that
often required multiple hours of debugging to root cause of failures to
improve test quality. Some notable changes include the following:

* [reduce unit tests runtime by half](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12286)
* [configure test logger](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12753)
* [simplify test data cleanup](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12805)
* [close gRPC servers after tests](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12782)

## Platforms

etcd presubmit tests are now fast and reliable, but were mostly running on x86
processors. And there have been numerous requests to support other architectures
like ARM (see [GitHub issue 12852](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12852)) and
s390x (see [GitHub issue 11163](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11163)).
A [self-hosted GitHub action runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners)
provides a consistent way of hosting various external test workers (see [GitHub
issue 12856](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12856)). Using the GitHub
action, etcd now [**runs tests on ARM-based AWS EC2 instances (Graviton)**](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12928),
thereby [**officially supporting ARM64 (aarch64) platform**](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12929).
In addition, we introduced a mechanism to support other platforms and
**categorized support tiers based on testing coverage**. For more information,
see the [Supported platforms documentation PR 273](https://github.com/etcd-io/website/pull/273) and the [Supported platforms documentation](https://github.com/etcd-io/website/pull/273).

## Developer experience

To better support integration with external projects, **etcd now fully
adopts the [Go 1.16 module](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules)**. This
brought challenges as the existing codebase made migration
arduous, causing [concerns regarding adoption in the community](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12484)). Tooling is an important
part of etcd development and as a result, we needed a better solution to support our contributor experience.

Using Go module enables clear
separation between server and client code, ease of change management for
dependency updates, and verifiable build system without a convoluted codebase for
vendoring. With reproducible builds in place, we eliminated the need for
vending dependency and as a result, we **reduced the etcd codebase size by half**.
See [ptabor@ of Google's modularization proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19UvKD7by_fEkzLMRi-QNSKEed4kYAW286S3DsNRPDOM/edit)
and [code change to remove the `vendor`
directory](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12279).

To better isolate dependency trees, the etcd command-line interface now has a new
administrative tool **`etcdutl` (not `etcdut-i-l`)**, and the sub-commands
include **`etcdutl snapshot`** and **`etcdutl defrag`**: The **`etcdctl
snapshot` and `etcdctl defrag` commands in previous releases are deprecated**.
This change aligns well with the new Go module layouts: `etcdctl` solely relies
on client v3 libraries, whereas `etcdutl` might depend on etcd server-side
packages, such as `bolt` and backend database code. See [ptabor@ of Google's code change](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12971).

To support [inclusive naming initiatives](https://inclusivenaming.org), etcd
projects renamed the default branch `master` to `main` (see [`etcd-io/etcd`
change](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12956) and [`etcd-io/website`
change](https://github.com/etcd-io/website/issues/149)). The migration was
seamless as GitHub handles the necessary redirects (see [GitHub
renaming](https://github.com/github/renaming)).

Each etcd write incurs an append message in Raft thus fsynced to disk. However, such
persistence might not be desirable for testing. To work around this, we've added the
`etcd --unsafe-no-fsync` flag to bypass disk writes for Raft WAL entries. See
[crawshaw@ of Tailscale's code change](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/11946) and [GitHub
issue 11930](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11930).

## Community

The diversity of etcd end users keeps expanding: Cloudflare
[relies on etcd for managing its data center](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-byzantine-failure-in-the-real-world),
Grafana Cortex [stores its configuration data in etcd](https://grafana.com/blog/2020/04/07/how-a-production-outage-in-grafana-clouds-hosted-prometheus-service-was-caused-by-a-bad-etcd-client-setup),
Netflix [Titus](https://netflix.github.io/titus/) uses etcd for [managing its container workloads](https://www.slideshare.net/aspyker/herding-kats-netflixs-journey-to-kubernetes-public),
and Tailscale
[runs its control plane on top of etcd](https://tailscale.com/blog/an-unlikely-database-migration).

We have also extended our team of vendor contributors.
In the etcd 3.5 release, we've [added two core
maintainers](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12624); [Wenjia Zhang](https://github.com/wenjiaswe)
of Google, who's been leading etcd
community meetings and Kubernetes integration, and [Piotr Tabor](https://github.com/ptabor)
of Google, who's been leading numerous bug
fixes and codebase modularization work.

The diversity of contributors is key to
building a sustainable, welcoming open source project and fostering manageable
work environments.

See the [2021 CNCF etcd project journey report](https://www.cncf.io/cncf-etcd-project-journey-report) for more information.

## New etcd.io

Since etcd joined [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io)
(CNCF) in [December 2018](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/12/11/cncf-to-host-etcd/), we have
refactored all user-facing documentation into a dedicated repository
[etcd-io/website](https://github.com/etcd-io/website) and [modernized its website
hosting with Hugo](https://github.com/etcd-io/website/pull/244)). The migration was a huge
undertaking that required multiple months of engineering efforts and
communication between maintainers. The very blog post you are reading now is
hosted on the new [etcd.io](https://etcd.io/blog), thanks to
[lucperkins@](https://github.com/lucperkins),
[chalin@](https://github.com/chalin) of CNCF,
[nate-double-u@](https://github.com/nate-double-u) of CNCF, and many other
community contributors.

## Future roadmaps

Traffic overloads can cause cascading node failures and as a result, scaling
such clusters becomes challenging and could impair the ability to recover from
quorum loss. With so many mission critical systems built on top of etcd,
defending etcd against overload is paramount. We will revisit the **etcd
throttle feature to shed excessive loads gracefully**. Currently, the etcd
project has two pending rate-limiter proposals: [vivekpatani@ of Apple's proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wQQ_L3cLyI1t14zp-PvarbjJYtlRsz_P9LwDR3uelc8/edit#heading=h.jofsq6eav4x7)
and [tangcong@ of Tencent's proposal](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12290).

Large range querying from `kube-apiserver` is still the most challenging source of
process crashing, as it is relatively unpredictable. Our heap profile on such
workloads found that **the etcd range request handler decodes and holds the entire
response before sending it out to gRPC server, adding up to 37% heap
allocation**. See *Figure 9* and [chaochn47@ of Amazon Web
Services's investigation](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12835).

Paginating range calls in client code doesn't fully address the issue,
because it entails additional consistency considerations and
still requires full relists for expired resources. For more
information, see [kube-apiserver v1.21 code](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/v1.21.0/staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/tools/cache/reflector.go#L302-L312)).
To work around this inefficiency, **etcd needs to support range streams**. We
will revisit [yangxuanjia@ of JD's range stream proposal](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/12343),
as it requires a significant level of effort to introduce such semantic changes
in etcd and in downstream projects.

![figure-9](../announcing-etcd-3.5/figure-9.png "Diagram showing etcd usage during a range query for listing Kubernetes pods")

_**Figure 9:** etcd usage during a range query for listing Kubernetes pods. 37% of the heap was allocated in etcd mvcc `rangeKeys` to hold key-value pairs for creating a range query response._

In order to reduce maintenance overhead, we are **completely deprecating
the etcd v2 API in favor of a more performant and widely adopted v3 API**.
The v2 storage translation layer  via `etcd --experimental-enable-v2v3`
remains experimental in 3.5 and to be removed in the
next release. For details, see
[ptabor@ of Google's proposal](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/12913).

Historically, etcd releases have been a large undertaking due to infrequency,
because of the large delta, and a need for release automation.
We will **develop an automated release system** that
is more accessible to the community.
