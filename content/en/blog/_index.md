# Notes:
# - Place blog entries under a folder corresponding to the year of publication.
# - By default the permalink will be /blog/year/filename. If you'd rather have
#   something different for the last part of the path, add a slug entry to your
#   blog entry front matter, like this:
# slug: permalink-last-part
