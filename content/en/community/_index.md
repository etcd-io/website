## Meeting schedule

Please refer to [the Kubernetes community](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-etcd/README.md#meetings) SIG etcd summary for the latest updates to etcd community meeting schedules.

### Community meetings & Issue triage

etcd contributors and maintainers meet [online][online] every week, on **Thursday
at 11 AM** [Pacific Time][Pacific Time], alternating between community meetings and issue
triage meetings. Issue triage meetings are aimed at getting through our backlog
of PRs and Issues. Triage meetings are open to any contributor; you don't have
to be a reviewer or approver to help out! They can also be a good way to get
started contributing.

For phone-in information, the date of the next meeting, minutes from past
meetings, and meeting recordings, see [etcd community meeting doc][community-meeting-doc].

### Operator working group

Join the [etcd operator working group](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/wg-etcd-operator) for discussions on the development and management of the etcd operator. These meetings are held biweekly and are open to all community members who wish to contribute or stay informed about the project.

**Meeting Schedule:**

- **Biweekly** on **Tuesdays at 11 AM** [Pacific Time][Pacific Time].

**Zoom Details:**
For phone-in information, the date of the next meeting, minutes from past
meetings, and meeting recordings, see
[etcd operator working group meeting doc][operator-wg-doc].

### Robustness tests

Join us for a collaborative exploration of etcd's correctness under pressure
[online][online] **biweekly**, on **Wednesday at 11 AM** [Pacific Time][Pacific Time]. Our goals are
to demystify distributed system testing by sharing knowledge and fostering a robust
testing culture within the etcd community, as well as to expand expertise by mentoring
new reviewers and approvers for etcd robustness tests. We invite community members to
propose items for the meetings.

For phone-in information, the date of the next meeting, minutes from past
meetings, and meeting recordings, see [etcd robustness tests meeting doc][robustness-tests-meeting-doc]
and [robustness tests meeting recordings][robustness-tests-meeting-recordings].
